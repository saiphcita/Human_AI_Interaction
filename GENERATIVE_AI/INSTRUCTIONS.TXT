# Assignment: Developing AI-Powered Web Plugins for Workplace Support

## Overview

In this assignment, you will develop a web plugin that leverages generative AI to support workers in 
their specific job roles. You should also address critical aspects of responsible AI use, including ethical 
considerations, biases, and implications for the workforce.

## Objectives

1. Identify a Workplace Need: Select a specific job role and identify a key area where AI can offer support. 
This could be anything from automating routine tasks, providing real-time data analysis, or assisting in creative processes.

2. Design the Plugin: Outline the functionality of your web plugin, how it integrates with existing systems, 
and how it utilizes generative AI. Consider user interface and experience in your design.

3. Develop a Prototype: Create a basic prototype of your plugin. This can be a combination of 
mock-ups and functional code demonstrating key features.

4. Ethical Considerations and Responsible AI: Address the following aspects in your 
design and report:
   - Bias Mitigation: How does your plugin account for and mitigate potential biases in AI-generated content or decisions?
   - Privacy and Data Security: Outline measures to protect user data and privacy.
   - Transparency and Accountability: Describe how your plugin maintains transparency in its AI processes and decisions.
   - Impact on Workforce: Discuss the potential impact of your AI tool on the job roles it is designed to support.

5. Testing and Feedback: Implement a testing phase for your plugin, gather feedback from potential 
users, and refine your tool accordingly.

6. Report: Compile a comprehensive report on your plugin, its features, and addressing all the objectives of this assignment.

## Questions for Consideration

1. What job role did you choose for your plugin, and why? How does generative AI specifically benefit this role?

2. How does your plugin ensure that the AI-generated content or suggestions are unbiased and fair?

3. Describe the measures implemented in your plugin to protect user privacy and data. How does your tool 
comply with relevant data protection laws (like GDPR)?

4. How does your plugin maintain transparency in its AI-driven processes? Is there a feature that allows users to understand how a certain output was generated?

5. Discuss the potential impacts of your plugin on the workforce. Does it automate tasks, and if so, how might 
this affect job roles?

6. Reflect on any ethical dilemmas you encountered while designing your plugin. How did you address them?

7. Based on the feedback received during testing, what were the major changes you made to your initial design?

## Submission Requirements

- Prototype: A functional or visual prototype of your plugin.
- Final Report: A detailed document addressing all objectives and questions. Make sure to present your web plugin, 
highlighting key features and findings.

## Evaluation Criteria

- Innovation and Practicality: How innovative and practical is the AI application in the chosen job role?
- Technical Implementation: Quality of the prototype and technical integration of AI.
- Ethical Considerations: Depth of analysis in addressing responsible AI use, bias, and ethical issues.
- Clarity and Comprehensiveness: Effectiveness in communication through the report and presentation.
- Feedback Integration: How well the student incorporated user feedback into the final design.
